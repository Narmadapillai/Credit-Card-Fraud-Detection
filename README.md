# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


**Methodology for Credit Card Fraud Detection Project:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather historical transaction data and preprocess it by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and create relevant features that help in distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

3. **Model Selection**: Apply various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train models on the preprocessed data and evaluate them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance through techniques like grid search or random search for the best hyperparameters.

6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time fraud detection and continuously monitor its performance.
